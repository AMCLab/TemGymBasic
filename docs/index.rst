TemGym Basic is a linear ray-tracing software that models and visualises first order behaviour of 
components inside a transmission electron microscope. The interactive models we generate are designed with a focus
on educating new users how some of the basic alignments work inside a TEM. It is also capable of producing publication
quality ray diagrams with a single function call. 

Features
--------

* Interactive TEM models generated with pyqtgraph & Pyqt5.

* Ready-made example direct alignment models that enable users to learn about alignments at their own pace in an offline manner.

* Qualitative interactive models of a Transmission Electron Microscope & Scanning Electron Microscopes.

* Easy to use python code which allows users to create their own models by naming components inside a python list.

* Generate publication quality ray diagrams of Electron Microscope Experimental Setups with one function call.
