=============
TemGym Basic
=============

TemGym Basic is a ray-tracing software that models and visualises the first order behaviour of 
components inside a transmission electron microscope.

The interactive models we generate are designed with a focus
on educating new users on how the basic alignments work inside a TEM. 
Our code is also capable of producing publication
quality ray diagrams with a single function call. 

Features
--------

* Interactive TEM models generated with pyqtgraph & PyQt5.

* Ready-made example direct alignment models that enable users to learn at their own pace in an offline manner.

* Generate interactive models of a transmission & scanning electron microscope.

* Easy to use python code which allows users to create their own models by naming components inside a python list.

* Generate publication quality ray diagrams of electron microscope experimental setups with one function call. 

Component Overview
------------------
Our python code consists of 8 different electron microscope components which can be combined
to create a model microscope. 

* Lens
* Astigmatic Lens
* Deflector
* Double Deflector
* Aperture
* Stigmator
* Biprism
* Sample

We can easily create an example model containing all of these components by first importing the required packages
into a python script.

.. literalinclude:: /../pyqtgraph_examples/all_components_example_pyqt.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-6

Then we add the components into a list, and specify their position inside the microscope on the z-axis.

.. literalinclude:: /../pyqtgraph_examples/all_components_example_pyqt.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 8-19

Then input the model into our pyqt function that creates the interactive 3D viewer and automatically populates
the GUI.

.. literalinclude:: /../pyqtgraph_examples/all_components_example_pyqt.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 21-22

which generates an interactive window on your PC.
